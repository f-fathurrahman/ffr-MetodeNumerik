If the program has a number in the book,this number is added at the end of the filename, where the "." has been replaced by an underscore "_",avoid problems with MATLAB-syntax.The subroutine names of these programs are without additional labeling.Some m-files are only dummies which explain where the correspondingfunctionality is found in the polygonal simulation code inthe directory  ../Hopper_HGNewNo example codes have been provided for listings with pseudocode, in particularly not for the three-dimensional simulation.Contents of the directory:README.txt   this filech1p32symp_visc_dry.m   Linear oscillator with and without viscous                         and dry friction, uses linosc_symp_visc_dry.mch2p67make_floatingpointgraphics.m  Program to generate a plot which shows for                         few bits how floating-point numbers are spaced with ch2_BDF.m  				Dummy file, links to the GEAR predictor-corrector (BDF2, BDF5)                        in ../Hopper_HGM_DEM_2Dch2p103pendulum.m       Pendulum realized with constraints (DAE), uses  pendulum.m  ch3p148frictionaloscillator.m   Stick-slip oscillator, uses  heun_const.m,                         stick_slip_oscillator.m, solout.mch5p207_fastFourier.m	Example to play around which data for periodic signals must                        be inputted in the fast Fourier transform to avoid artefacts                        from redundant data points											ch5p209KortewegDeVriesSoliton5_4.m	Solitonic solution for the non-linear Korteweg DeVries       	                equationch5p201phonon1D_simplified_dos5_1_5_2.m Numerical calculation of the dispersion relation                         for a linear chain in one dimension with equal spring constants                        and equal masses, as well as calculation of the density of statesch5p203phonon1D_disorder5_3.m Numerical calculation of the dispersion relation                         for a linear chain in one dimension with disorder in the                        masses and the sprint constants		 ch7p225pointparticledem7_1.m Bouncing point particle with purely elastic interaction,                        uses bouncing_ball.mch7p225pointparticledem7_3.m Bouncing point particle with elastic interaction and                        damping, uses bouncing_ball_dissipation.m where attraction                        due to damping is eliminated   ch7p225pointparticledem7_3.m Bouncing point particle with elastic interaction and                        damping, uses bouncing_ball_dissipation7_4.m where attraction                        due to damping and the jump at the closing of the 						contact is eliminated   				ch7p229roundparticlesimulation7_4.m Simulation with many elastic round particle in one                        (z-) dimension, uses DEMround1D.m ch7p232roundparticlesimulation7_6.m Simulation with many elastic round particle in two                        dimensions, uses DEMround2Dnorot.m                                  ch7p252polygonrotation.m Dummy file, links to the particle rotation                        in ../Hopper_HGM_DEM_2D               ch7p253polygoninitialization.m  Dummy file, links to the particle initialization                        in ../Hopper_HGM_DEM_2Dch7p263sortandsweep.m Dummy file, links to the neighborhood routine                         in ../Hopper_HGM_DEM_2DappAp419driverode.m     Simple driver for the ODE y'=y, uses expfun.m       appAp419_420driverode.m  Driver for the ODE y'=y, uses expfun.m with various                        accuracies
