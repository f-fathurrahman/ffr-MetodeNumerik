% an example of a neighborhood algorithm using
% the sort and sweep approach can be found in 
%  neighborhood_algorithm.m
% and its functions in the directory
% ../Hopper_HGM_DEM_2D
% If the algorithm for one dimensional is needed,
% the functions for the x-coordinate in
%  neighborhood_algorithm.m can be used
