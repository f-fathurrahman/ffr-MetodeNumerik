1. The programs are written in MATLAB, for MATLAB:
 It may be that some of the programs run in MATLAB-clones
 like OCTAVE, but we cannot guarantee the correct functionality.
2. The page- and section numbers in the comments refer to the book.
3. The purpose of these programs is not to supply a perfectly running code 
 (though they should be sufficiently bug-free to use it for simulations, 
 in particular dr_particledry_hg and its subroutines),
 but to illustrate the concepts from the book, including
 various programming approaches, documentation examples etc.
