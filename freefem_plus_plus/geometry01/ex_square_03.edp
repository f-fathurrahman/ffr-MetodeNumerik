/*
Adding the named parameter flags=icase with icase:

0 - will produce a mesh where all quads are split
    with diagonal xâˆ’y=constant

1 - will produce a Union Jack flag type of mesh

2 - will produce a mesh where all quads are split with diagonal x+y=constant

3 - same as in case 0, except two corners where the triangles are
    the same as case 2, to avoid having 3 vertices on the boundary

4 - same as in case 2, except two corners where the triangles are
    the same as case 0, to avoid having 3 vertices on the boundary
