kl\\_bicgstab( x0, b, atv, V, eta, ptv = nothing;

C. T. Kelley, 2022

BiCGSTAB linear solver. Deals with preconditioning. 
Uses bicgstab\\_base with is oblivious to that.

The code works and does what it needs to do, but ...\n
The user interface is unstable and, even worse,
the nonlinear solvers are not hooked up yet.

The way this works it 

Input:\n
x0:  initial iterate, this is usually zero for nonlinear solvers

b: right hand side (duh!)

atv:  matrix-vector product which depends on precomputed data pdta
      I expect you to use pdata most or all of the time, so it is not
      an optional argument, even if it's nothing (at least for now).
      If your mat-vec is just A*v, you have to write a function where
      A is the precomputed data.
      API for atv is av=atv(v,pdata)

V: a vector for me to store a Jacobian-vector product. It goes where 
   FPS would go in gmres. You are best served if V is Float64.

eta: Termination happens when ||b - Ax|| <= eta || b ||

ptv:  preconditioner-vector product, which will also use pdata. The
      default is nothing, which is no preconditioning at all.
      API for ptv is px=ptv(x,pdat) just like kl\\_gmres

Keyword arguments

kl\\_store: You have the option of giving me some room
         for the vectors bicgstab needs to do its work. These in
         which I will not overwrite and a couple of vectors I use
         in the iteration. If you're only doing a linear solve, it
         does no harm to let me allocate those vectores in kl\\_bicgstab.
         The way to preallocate is ```kl_store=kstore(n,"bicgstab")``` where n
         is the number of unknows. I call this myself in the initialization
         phase if you don't do it ahead of me.


side: left or right preconditioning. The default is "right".

lmaxit: maximum number of linear iterations. The default is 10.

pdata: precomputed data. The default is nothing, but that ain't gonna
        work well for nonlinear equations.

Output:\n
A named tuple (sol, reshist, lits, idid)

where


sol= final result
reshist = residual norm history
lits = number of iterations
idid = status of the iteration
       true -> converged
       false -> failed to converge

### Examples from the docstrings for kl\\_bicgstab

In these examples you have the matrix and use
```
function atv(x, A)
    return A * x
end
```
to compute the matvec.

#### Three dimensional problem.

Will converge in the four iterations (worse than kl_gmres)

```jldoctest
julia> function atv(x, A)
           return A * x
       end
atv (generic function with 1 method)

julia> A = [0.001 0 0; 0 0.0011 0; 0 0 1.e4];

julia> V = zeros(3); b = [1.0; 1.0; 1.0]; x0 = zeros(3);

julia> norm(b - A*gout.sol,Inf)
3.68594e-13
```

#### Integral equation. Notice that pdata has the kernel of the
operator and we do the matvec directly. Just like the previous example.
We put the grid information and, for this artifical example, the solution
in the precomputed data.

```jldoctest
julia> function integop(u, pdata)
                  K = pdata.K
                  return u - K * u
              end

                  h = 1 / n
                  X = collect(0.5*h:h:1.0-0.5*h)
                  K = [ker(x, y) for x in X, y in X]
                  K .*= h
                  sol = [usol(x) for x in X]
                  f = sol - K * sol
                  pdata = (K = K, xe = sol, f = f)
                  return pdata
              end
integopinit (generic function with 1 method)

julia> function usol(x)
                  return exp.(x) .* log.(2.0 * x .+ 1.0)
              end
usol (generic function with 1 method)
